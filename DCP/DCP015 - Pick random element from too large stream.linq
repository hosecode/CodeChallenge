/*
This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

void Main()
{
	//This requries some clarifying questions
	//do we know the number of elements
	//can that number fit in an int/long
	//is the stream fix, or is new data streaming in.
	//what if we just split elements in half based on rnd(), until only 1 element
}

// Define other methods and classes here
