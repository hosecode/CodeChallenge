/*
This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.
You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

void Main()
{
	//Could store in linked list and add to the head and delete the N+1 tail, but access would be N
	//If N is known and fixed can store in an array as a circular buffer with a pointer. This would have O(1) lookups and O(n) memory
	RecentOrders ro = new RecentOrders(1);
	ro.AddOrder("a");
	ro.get_last(1).Dump("Expect: a");
	ro.AddOrder("b");
	ro.AddOrder("c");
	ro.get_last(1).Dump("Expect: c");

	ro = new RecentOrders(3);
	ro.AddOrder("a");
	ro.AddOrder("b");
	ro.AddOrder("c");
	ro.get_last(1).Dump("Expect: c");
	ro.get_last(2).Dump("Expect: b");
	ro.get_last(3).Dump("Expect: a");
